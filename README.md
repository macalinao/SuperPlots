Enchanced land ownership for Minecraft.

Building
--------

Get Apache Maven version 3 and run `mvn` in your terminal in the project's base directory. Done.

FAQ
---

=== Nani kore?!?

People buy spheres of land that they can share with their friends.

=== But why spheres????

Spheres don't make it so all possible land is used up. The other option was cubes, but I didn't like having huge corners. Spheres allow more freedom rather than strange boxes.

=== Can I use this for my server?!?!? Where's the JAR!?!?!

Sure, but you can't modify it unless you share the source. Read the license. And read the **Building** section if you want to know how to make a JAR.

=== OMG Y U NO USE MYSQL?!

Because I don't need to (as of the moment). I'll probably start using it when performance starts to decrease. Most of the operations are handled in-memory, so there's no need to actually use MySQL unless I have over 1GB of plots I need to store in memory. Which by then, I'll have moved over to Spout or something and have started a new server.

=== WER R DA DOCS?!

I don't have public documentation yet. Once I set up Apache and Mediawiki, there will be docs.
